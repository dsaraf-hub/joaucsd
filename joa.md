          <p class="cta-text">Java OceanAtlas (JOA) is a Java application for Windows and MacOS which provides
an ad hoc (rather than pre-set) graphic exploration environment optimized to examine
and plot oceanographic profile data. JOA works with any pressure- or depth-indexed
data. Plots include property-property plots, maps, offset profiles (waterfall), contoured
section plots, and plots of calculated values, using color-by-property-value as a plotted
variable to aid interpretation. There is also a comprehensive data display window and
extensive support for data import, export, editing, filtering and quality control functions.
All Java OceanAtlas plots and the data window are linked and may be ‘browsed’ jointly
by sample and/or station. JOA user interfaces are similar to those used in commercial
applications. Many different types of calculations can be performed.</p>
