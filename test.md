	<h2>Starting Java OceanAtlas</h2>
	<div id="guided_tour_content">
		<p>Start the Java OceanAtlas application (e.g., by double-clicking on its icon). You will see a small window. On Windows and Linux, JOA's menubar is contained in this initial window (hence it's presence). On Mac OS X, JOA's menubar is at the top of the screen in adherance to Apple's UI conventions.</p>
	<p>Use the open command in the File menu to locate and open the Atlantic 11&deg;S .poa data file. A few seconds later the standard Data Window will open (Figure 1).</p>
		<p>The Data Window provides a common reference for the Java OceanAtlas plots. As we will see in Browsing, parts of it act like a movable magnifying glass on the data set. The Data Window can be moved anywhere on your monitor by click/holding on the title bar and dragging it.</p>

<p>If you are new to oceanography you might not be aware that one of the methods oceanographers utilize to collect information about the origin and circulation of ocean waters is to occupy - from a research vessel - a line of &deg;stations&deg;  across a region of interest. Such a line is usually called a &deg;section&deg;. A &deg;statio&deg; is a location where the ship stops and takes observations, in this case of the physical/chemical characteristics of the water column. (There are many different types of oceanographic expeditions and observations. Here we focus on the types which produce the data Java OceanAtlas was designed to explore.)</p>

<p>Water column measurements made from the end of the 1800s through the 1970s were typically made by attaching water bottles (with open lids) onto a wire lowered into the ocean. When all the bottles were deployed at the intended levels a &#39;messenger&#39; (brass weight) was dropped down the wire. When a messenger reached a water bottle it closed the bottle, caused a deep-sea reversing thermometer to reverse (and thus break the mercury column and preserve its temperature reading), and release another messenger to head down to the next bottle, and so on.</p>
